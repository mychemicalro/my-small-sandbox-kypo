The tests are performed on a sandbox consisting of a single host machine which it is not necessary to interact with. The levels contain instructions for testing aspects of the KYPO-CRP that cannot be tested automatically. \n\nEach level description contains three sections, each dedicated to actions that need to be performed by a specific user. At the end of the training, a feedback visualization will be displayed. In it, you can find a total amount of points earned by each user, depending on their actions. Check this value against the value stated in the last level.\n\n`Admin`, and `instructor` should know all the pre-training assessment answers. Trainee should have everything wrong in the pre-training assessment."

In this case, go to the main menu in the top left corner of your attacker machine, then `Settings` and `Display` and set a lower resolution.\n\nFor this session, we strongly recommend setting up and using an SSH connection (not only the web console).\n\nWhen you are sure that you can connect to the attacker machine, submit `start` to proceed to the first training phase.\n\n**Do not enter the following answer before you have set up your access.**\n",
